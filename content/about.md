I am Jason Scheirer, a completely unremarkable software developer in the Bay Area initially from the Inland Empire. A rough timeline of my life as a software engineer:

* Start programming BASIC in elementary school
* Get a part-time job in late high school writing "web applications"
* Get bored in intro CS classes and change majors to Linguistics
* Backpedal and get as much CS coursework done as possible before hitting the Unit Limit for graduation
* List about from company to company in SoCal writing software for 10 years, mostly Python/C, mostly geospatial adjacent
* Move to Bay Area and list about from startup to startup writing software for 6 years and counting, mostly Python

The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol), built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the magic of [a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). I'm using Plex and Fira Code (both hosted here and not on Google Fonts) so my indulgence of picking custom type shouldn't hurt the load times of the pages as much as it _could_.

If I can ask you but one favor, it is this: if you like the site, tell immediate friends and subscribe to it in your favorite RSS reader. Please _do not_ share links to it on any site with a comments section. I do not write to provide Internet Brain Geniuses with material to fractally complain about to feel better about themselves on Social Media. I would rather those people not know I exist.

If this site provides you with value, great. If not, keep in mind I owe you nothing.
