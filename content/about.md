I am Jason Scheirer, a completely unremarkable software developer in the Bay Area initially from the Inland Empire. A rough timeline of my life as a software engineer:

* Start programming BASIC in elementary school
* Get a part-time job in late high school writing "web applications"
* Get bored in intro CS classes and change majors to Linguistics
* Backpedal and get as much CS coursework done as possible before hitting the Unit Limit for graduation
* List about from company to company in SoCal writing software for 10 years, mostly Python/C, mostly geospatial adjacent
* Move to Bay Area and list about from startup to startup writing software for 6 years and counting, mostly Python

The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol), built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the magic of [a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
