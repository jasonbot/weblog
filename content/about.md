I am Jason Scheirer, a completely unremarkable software developer in the Bay Area initially from the Inland Empire. A rough timeline of my life as a software engineer:

- Start programming BASIC in elementary school, escalating to pirated QuickBasic and Turbo Pascal, as well as legal but squirrely [DJGPP](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/)/[RHIDE](http://www.rhide.com/)/[Allegro](https://liballeg.org/)
- Get a part-time job in late high school writing "web applications"
- Get bored in intro CS classes and change majors to Linguistics
- Decide that taking a mere full courseload is for suckers who like sleep and good grades and work 30 hrs/wk to pay tuition and take night classes to teach English at the same time
- Backpedal and get as much CS coursework done as possible before hitting the unit limit for graduation, managing to squeeze in the minor just in time
- List about from company to company in SoCal writing software for 10 years, mostly Python/C, mostly geospatial adjacent
- Move to Bay Area and list about from startup to startup writing software, mostly Python

A rough timeline of my entire life, including the future:

- Born
- Childhood
- Early adulthood
- Adulthood
- Writing bullet points in a text editor
- _(Speculative)_ Dead

The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol), built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the magic of [a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). I'm using [Reforma](https://pampatype.com/reforma), [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto) (hosted here and not on Google Fonts) so my indulgence of picking custom type shouldn't hurt the load times of the pages as much as it _could_ (or spy on you).

For diagrams and artwork I use [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/) and an older version of [Xara Photo and Graphic Designer](https://www.xara.com/us/photo-graphic-designer/). Sometimes [The Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) come along for the party, too.

I do not have any sort of analytics on this page. I have no idea what my traffic or "engagement" stats look like. I could be getting 1 hit a month, I could be getting 100000 hits a day on some single blog post. I honestly have no idea and it's not something I want to think about.

There's also no Javascript on this page. I can't justify "enhancing" the "experience" of viewing words on a screen with some stupid runtime-in-the-browser trickery.

(Late 2022 update: Javascript exists, where necessary, for "functional" pages like to display games but not for content load or navigation UI trickery.)

If I can ask you but one favor, it is this: if you like the site, tell immediate friends and subscribe to it in your favorite RSS reader. I do not write to provide Internet Brain Geniuses with material to fractally complain about to feel better about themselves on Social Media. I would rather those people not know I exist. Please only share these posts on places where the comments section do not devolve into utter idiocy.

If this site provides you with value, great. If not, keep in mind I owe you nothing.
