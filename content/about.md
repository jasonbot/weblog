I am Jason Scheirer, a completely unremarkable software developer in the Bay Area initially from the Inland Empire. I have been programming since I was in elementary school. I got my first job writing "web applications" as a junior in high school and have been doing it ever since. I have been out of school since 2005, writing software full time ever since.

The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol).
