So I [bought that dang Chromebook](/weblog/make-a-chromebook-a-developer-machine/) over three years ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play them via VLC for my kid.

All in all, the Chromebook was a good purchase, it has served many purposes, and it's lasted a lot longer than a lot of other laptops I've owned (Surface Pro, looking at you).

I've got a Pinebook Pro on the way, here's hoping that lasts as long (and is as useful).
