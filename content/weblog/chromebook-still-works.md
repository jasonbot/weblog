So I [bought that dang Chromebook](/weblog/make-a-chromebook-a-developer-machine/) over three eyars ago at this point and it keeps chugging on. Google has continued to ship OS updates (which I only notice as weird, arbitrary UI changes) and I can still use it to code but its main purpose now is its new life: ChromeOS now runs Android apps pretty well, so I put an SD card full of movies on it and play the mvia VLS for my kid.

I've got a Pinebook on the way, here's hoping that lasts as long (and is as useful).
