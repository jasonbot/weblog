I gave a short (~10) minute talk on [preparing to move to microservices](https://github.com/jasonbot/python-meetup-2019-10-09) at the Python meetup in San Francisco.

The main points:

* We all start out with a monolith
* The monolith never fully goes away
* That's fine
* Scope out a new project to make your first microservice
* Pull out a relatively isolated piece of code in the monolith to make your next microservice
