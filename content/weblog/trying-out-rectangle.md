I've been using the [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) window manager for mac for the last couple of weeks and it's been the most helpful thing since Mission Control (and setting up a hot corner to activate it).

I've tried to use full tiling managers before but I've found it difficult because 1) Irregularly sized window totally mess up the flow, 2) I am so used to the WIMP paradigm, including moving windows around so I have only been semi-functional with and 3) really weird shortcuts I have to memorize.

I tried sway on my Linux laptop and could never really "get" it -- I'm not smart enough, and I didn't like the idea of using Gnome again because it's gotten so big, but I've recently found great success in using [gTile](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/76) in Cinnamon.

I like apps like Rectangle because they take a middle ground to window management -- they don't have a complex set of layout paradigms they don't take full assumption of positionin window, and they have very, very name, very easy to learn defaults.
