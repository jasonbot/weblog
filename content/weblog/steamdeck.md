I bought a [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/). I was on a waiting list that said I would get it until this year (2023), but it arrived in October 2022.

This thing is so versatile thanks to its Desktop Mode. For games like the boomer shooters I so love, I can dock the Deck and play with a mouse and keyboard and nicer monitor. I can install Flatpaks.

The gaming experience is bar none the best. Steam OS is an accomplishment. It has none of the fiddly bits around power management etc that a standard Linux machine does. It's a usable, console-quality experience.
