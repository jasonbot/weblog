# Introduction

My [Shanling Q1 died after a couple of years of heavy use](/weblog/shanling-q1/) and I think it was probably fixable with some soldering but I don't have time for that.

In a rush, I bought an [M0s](https://en.shanling.com/article-IntroM0s.html) not reading the page and thinking it was the higher-end [M0 Pro](https://en.shanling.com/product/429), but ultimately this was not a big deal!

# Usage

This still works like the Q1: it has a custom proprietary Shanling OS which works pretty well. It does Bluetooth fine, it manages music via TF card the same.

The thing I did not realize was how much I'd like how small it is, it's a tiny little 1.5inc square that's about half an inch thick and has barely any mass. It just dangles at the end of the end of my headphone cable. It would be very easy to lose if I were more careless.

# Conclusion

In all, it has served me for a year. No complaints.
