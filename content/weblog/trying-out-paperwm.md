I'm an enthusiast of playing around with different window management schemes. I like the _idea_ of a tiling window manager, but I'm not smart enough to ever get really productive in something like i3 or sway.

for the past few years [I've been using Rectangle on MacOS](/weblog/trying-out-rectangle/) as something of a band-aid

I've been using [the Tiling WM Extension ion Gnome](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7065/tiling-shell/) for a while, and I've been pretty happy with it. It does a good job of emulating [one of the better features on Win11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241), a progressive way to arrange windows in an ordered way.

Now I'm [trying out PaperWM](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6099/paperwm/). The concept simplifies and streamlines windows fro occupying a fully two dimensional space into something resembling 1.5 dimensions: windows are all arranged side-by-side infinitely, and you just traverse along the line of windows to find what you're looking for.

I've been using it full time for a week and I'm pretty happy with it. Maybe this will stick for a while.

**Update 2024-11-22:** PaperWS hard crashes when I launch games that try to switch to fullscreen from Steam. Back to the drawing board!
