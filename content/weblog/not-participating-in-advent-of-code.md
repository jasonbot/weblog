I'm not participating in his year's Advent of Code.

# It Emphasizes Fast Solutions over Good Ones

The entire gamification of the problems is about solving them as quickly as possible. Not about maintainable solutions, not rewarding cleverness, the scoreboard is entirely fueled by finishing quickly.

A professional software engineer does not hammer out code as quickly as possible. There are optimization and organizational and maintainability issues to consider.

# It's not realistic

I don't write parser/combinators in my day-to-day. While they may be fun, most of my day is reading standard library documentation and wrestling with Tailwind. These problems are fun, but flexing muscles I do not use regularly and can work out when I do need them.

# It represents a dark "Third Place"

In general, a "third place" is a place outside of work and home like a coffee shop where one might recharge and socialize. Advent of Code is the same thing -- it's not a work project, it's not a personal project, it's some third thing.

In this way it's not constructive: it's hard to justify doing 'empty' coding where you're nod advancing a side project or your employer's goals.

# Its timing is in the worst part of the year

I'm flying in December. I'm driving. I'm spending time going to my kid's Christmas concerts. I'm not around at 9:00 PM every night to rush through a problem and it consistently gives me anxiety when I try to participate.
