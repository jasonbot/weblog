I bought a [Devterm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm) a couple of years ago and it's mostly been sitting in a drawer.

## The good

* The thermal printer is novel
* The form factor makes it super portable

## The bad

* OS support is not great, at one point I built my own Raspbian image because the official one had drifted so far out of date that the apt repos stopped working
* The keyboard and trackball (even with flashed firmware) are painful to use
