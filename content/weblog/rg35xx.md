Wanting a small, pocketable handheld for bus rides, etc., I saw the [Miyoo Mini](https://www.keepretro.com/products/miyoo-mini) and attempted to purchase one. They are _incredibly_ hard to acquire.

The [Anbernic RG35XX](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx) presented itself as an alternative, and it was actually possible to buy one.

I got one for about $60 on Amazon and was immediately in love. It had a decent built in game library, decent battery life, and was the perfect size. Not too big, not to small. Fits in a pants pocket or a little random orner of a carrying bag no problem.

The stock SD card and OS is servicable, but I replaced it with my own SD card with my own legally acquired ROM library. I use [GarlicOS](https://www.patreon.com/posts/garlicos-for-76561333) and I'm quite happy with it. At one point [I even made a skin for it](https://github.com/jasonbot/platinum-garlic). I normally play Neo-Geo, PSX, and GBA games. The best part about emulation is that all those quarter munchers become way more playable when you just have to hit select to insert a quarter. On an average Metal Slug run (any sequel) it would have cost me close to $20 based on how many times I get game overs.

I like it so much that I bought my 5 year old one and put [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/union-minui) on it. Aside from being largely text-based which isn't great for a 5 year old, it's super usable and its no-frills approach makes it ideal for people who just want to play games.

My only concern is that the only firmware that runs Dreamcast is [Batocera](https://rg35xx-cfw.github.io/), which I am not particularly inclined to use as a daily driver.

Honestly, I play this more than my Steam Deck. I take it with me all the time since it's so small. Waiting rooms, the bus, it's a great little thing to pull out when you have a few seconds to spare.
