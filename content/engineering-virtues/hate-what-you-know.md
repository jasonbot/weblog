The title _Hate What You Know_ is admittedly vague, I know! There are a handful of directions I'll go with it, bear with me.

I'm an advocate of being a craftsperson out of anger. I'll make a deliberately outrageous claim: doing something out of need is craft, doing something out of compulsion is art. A craftsman makes a work because they see something missing in the world. An artist makes a work because they see something of a possibility in the world. Professionally, at least, you're hopefully operating in the former camp. In the latter, you're either outrageously lucky doing what you love in a place of psychological safety or secretly pissing everyone off around you by being a perfectionist primadonna.

# The Opposite of Hate is not Love, It's Indifference

Hate, as opposed to love, comes with a much different place of origin when setting expectations: you presume the worst rather than the best when approaching it. This sets you up for disillusionment when the thing you can see no wrong in eventually fails you in some way. Never meet your heroes. Heck, never watch a hero on a bad day.
