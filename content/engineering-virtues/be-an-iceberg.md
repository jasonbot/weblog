> Be overprepared.

![Iceberg](/images/passively-transparent/iceberg.svg)

As the phrase goes, _don't let your mouth write checks your ass can't cash_. Send along curated information that is a good summary of what you are doing, but be able to support it with research, opinion, or buy-in when pushed. Reveal enough to convey that you are a force, but do not reveal _everything_.

Do not operate at 100% capacity at all times, aim to operate at 80% so that when you _really_ need to you can crank up your productivity in a sustainable way.

Always have a strategic reserve of competence.

> This is not an advocacy of actual laziness, it is pace-setting to prevent burn out and preparation to in anticipation of future needs.
