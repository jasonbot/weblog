> For the 500 lines of boilerplate, _what are the five truly interesting lines that solve the problem_?

In the course of my problem solving, _especially_ when I am solving a problem I think [shouldn't be hard](../this-shouldnt-be-hard/), I think back to the essential _core_ of the problem

Typically a fix is a couple of API calls or a single clever data structure.

As a consequence of this, I typically annotate my Pull Requests with an annotated "this is the interesting part" section. I recommend this approach: you are asking your reviewers for special attention on the original thoughts, and signaling the other code you had to write is something you do not feel is important, and are far more open to nitpicking on (versus thoughful review).

Pair this with _This Shouldn't Be Hard_: You just need those five lines of beauty and then you need to do the 500 lines of ceremony to make them real.
