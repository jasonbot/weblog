I've found that my productivity varies wildly based on the time of year, the phase of the moon, my mental state, the quality of my morning shower thought session, and **how enthuisiastic I am about what I'm working on**.

I like to give myself "little treat" issues ocasionally to keep my motivation up: issues I pick up outside of the product backlog that are quick to fix, fun to do, and give me little dopamine hits.

These keep my average motivation level up, give me a chance to remember why I'm a software engineer, and don't really eat into the time I already have budgeted to work on other stuff: I'm highly motivated to get it done, so I do it quickly and enthusiastically and it doesn't make my slog work any slower to deliver.

Give yourself treats. Side projects. Little tweaks. Fun stuff.
