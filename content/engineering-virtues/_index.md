This is a series I am writing based on my experience as a software engineer. In this are a list of things that I hold important in myself and others as a software engineer, mostly vis-a-vis being an individual contributor interfacing with engineering management, product teams, and supporting organizations.

I'm trying to write things that are useful that you probably would not find in any conventional book of professional advice. Use this as a cheeky supplement to other career guides you may use.
