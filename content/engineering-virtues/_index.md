This is a series I am writing based on my experience as a software engineer. In this are a list of things that I hold important in myself and others as a software engineer, mostly vis-a-vis being an individual contributor interfacing with engineering management, product teams, and supporting organizations.

Note this probably isn't going to be advice you fins elsewhere and it's not going to be garden path. It's idiosycratic, somewhat anti-authoritarian survival skills.
