# Development

## Languages/Technologies

- I am primarily a Python expert (25 years!)
- I am primarily a [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) user, and I am better than average at doing async programming (which sucks and is bad, but it's fun to do bad things)
- I primarily choose Postgres as my database
- I reluctantly use Ruby at my office
- I do most of my personal tasks in Go
- If you ask me to write something in C++ I will say no but I _will_ write C++ to spite you
- I prefer Linux desktop to Mac at this point
- I usually prefer Debian stable or one of its relatives for servers and Alpine for container base images
- I use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) at home, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) at work
- I use [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [plain old JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) at home, [React](https://react.dev/) at work
- I use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on Mac and Linux to locally run LLMs

## Editors/Environments

- My muscle memory is [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), I use it everywhere
- Most of my polyglot development is via [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- I am forcing myself to use [Zed](https://zed.dev/) more too, just because monocultures are aa Bad Idea and VSC is a monoculture now
- I like using [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) to make silly 2D games
- I like [git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for command line diffing
- I usually use zsh and start out with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on new systems
- [Here is the bootstrap set of dotfiles I use](https://github.com/jasonbot/dotfiles) on new computers

## Cloud Stuff

- In the past, I did [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- At my last job, I learned a little [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
- At most places of employment, I use [AWS](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- I had to learn [Azure](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status) at my last job
- At home, I use [GCP](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
- I am in the process of switching my self-hosted stuff over to [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

# This Site

- The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol), built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the magic of [a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
- **Fonts**: I'm using [Reforma](https://pampatype.com/reforma), [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto) (hosted here and not on Google Fonts).

# Hardware

I have a handful of computers I use regularly!

- An older Legion desktop running [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) for gaming and general computing
- [Pinebook Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinebook_pro/) for remote terminal stuff and a lightweight Miniflux client
- [AOKZOE A1](https://aokzoestore.com/products/aokzoe-8-inch-amd%C2%AE-ryzen%C2%AE-6800u) for handheld PC gaming, also using its Gnome desktop as a portable development setup
- Whatever the smallest iPhone is on the market at the time for doomscrolling

# Productivity

## Visual Artifacts

- [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/) for cool text-mode diagrams
- [Xara Photo and Graphic Designer](https://www.xara.com/us/photo-graphic-designer/) as I have muscle memeory and it's fast to make drawings in
- [The Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for quick raster touchups
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) come along for the party, too
- [Inkscape](https://flathub.org/apps/org.inkscape.Inkscape) to touch up SVGs
- [D2](https://d2lang.com/) for diagrams as code -- I like it in terms of how clean the language looks, how clean the output looks, and how easy it is to use
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagrams extensively because it's everywhere, mark a code block as `mermaid` in markdown and you get the rendering for free in things like Obsidian and on Github
