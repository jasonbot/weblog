# Development

## Languages/Technologies

- I am primarily a Python expert (25 years!)
- I am primarily a [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) user, and I am better than average at doing async programming (which sucks and is bad, but it's fun to do bad things)
- I primarily choose Postgres as my database
- I do most of my personal dev projects in Go
- Over the last 3-5 years, Typescript has become the dominant language I use at work
- If you ask me to write something in C++ I will say no but I _will_ write C++ to spite you
- I prefer Linux on the desktop to Mac on the desktop at this point
  - I do not value my time or sanity
  - If something is reliable, I get bored and self-destructive so I need to be in a state of crisis in all aspects of my life and a Linux desktop fills that need in this space
- I now prefer Fedora and Fedoralikes for desktop Linux
- I usually prefer Debian stable or one of its relatives for servers and Alpine for container base images
- I use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) at home for CSS, often tableflipping and reverting to vanilla CSS
- I use [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [plain old JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) at home, [React](https://react.dev/) at work
- I use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on Windows, Mac and Linux to locally run LLMs

## Editors/Environments

- My muscle memory is [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), I use it everywhere
- Most of my polyglot development is via [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - I use LLMs for developing code signficiantly less than other people on the cutting edge of tech. I have the [Continue plugin](https://www.continue.dev/) installed at home against local Ollama but use its features quite sparingly.
- I am forcing myself to use [Zed](https://zed.dev/) more too, just because monocultures are a Bad Idea and VSC is a monoculture now
- I like using [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) to make silly 2D games
- I also (rarely) play around with [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php), [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) and [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) for the same

## Command line

- [Here is the bootstrap set of dotfiles I use](https://github.com/jasonbot/dotfiles) on new computers
- On Windows, [I'm doing the same thing but different](https://github.com/jasonbot/bootstrap-windows-development-machine) with setting up a new machine.
- I use zsh and bash almost equally, though I think I have more zsh machines now
- I usually start out with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) or [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash) on new systems
- I use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), and [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage node/ruby/python installs -- I can't get the hang of [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) but that looks like the future at this point for Python.
- I use `grep`, [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) in descending order of frequency
- I like [git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for command line diffing
- I like [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for some easy to explain but harder to do than necessary git operations. Sometimes a GUI (or a TUI) is nice! Not everything has to be commands or code!
- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) loads a hell of a lot faster than any other offering for looking at running containers in a reasonably high level way

### It Came from Userspace

- I always add `~/.local/bin` and `~/bin/` to my `$PATH` so I can manage my own binaries without superuser perms
- I download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (setting `$GOPATH` to `~/.go`) from tarballs and manage them myself, adding `~/go/bin` and `~/VSCode-linux-x64/bin` to `$PATH` -- that way I don't need to deal with native packages or elevated install permissions
- Same with [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- Currently in `~/bin`: `btm` `slirp4netns`[^1] `tmux` `tic80` (static binaries acquired from their release pages)
  [^1]: This is missing in ChimeraOS for some reason and the only part absent from a working podman setup on my handheld

## Cloud Stuff

- In the past, I did [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- At my last job, I learned a little [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
- At most places of employment, I use [AWS](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- I had to learn [Azure](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status) at my last job
- At home, I use [GCP](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
- I am in the process of switching my self-hosted stuff over to [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

# This Site

- The theme for this weblog is a fork of [smol](https://github.com/colorchestra/smol), built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through the magic of [a CNAME](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
- **Fonts**: I'm using [Forevs](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/forevs), [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto) (hosted here and not on Google Fonts).

# Productivity

## Producing and Manipulating Visual Artifacts

- [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/) for cool text-mode diagrams
- [Xara Photo and Graphic Designer](https://www.xara.com/us/photo-graphic-designer/) as I have muscle memory and it's fast to make drawings in
- [The Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for quick raster touchups
- [Inkscape](https://flathub.org/apps/org.inkscape.Inkscape) to touch up SVGs
- [D2](https://d2lang.com/) for diagrams as code -- I like it in terms of how clean the language looks, how clean the output looks, and how easy it is to use
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagrams extensively because it's everywhere, mark a code block as `mermaid` in markdown and you get the rendering for free in things like Obsidian and on Github
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) comes along for the party, too -- it's old but it gets the job done for a large range of jobs
