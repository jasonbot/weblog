I've spend the first just-under-a-year [at Notion working on the desktop team](https://www.notion.com/desktop). I was hired, strangely enough, as a "Windows guy" after over a decade of absence from the platform.

The largest single deliverable in this time _by far_ has been providing [an MSIX packaged Windows distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview) for the main Desktop product.
